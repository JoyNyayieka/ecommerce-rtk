## React + Redux Toolkit E-Commerce Lab

### Overview
In this lab, I built a simple e-commerce web application using **React** and **Redux Toolkit** for efficient global state management.  
The goal was to practice implementing Redux to manage shared state and create a seamless shopping cart experience.

---

### Features Implemented
- **Redux Toolkit Integration** — Implemented Redux Toolkit for **universal state management** across the application.  
-  **Product Listing** — Displayed a list of products, each with an **“Add to Cart”** button.  
-  **Cart Functionality** — Allowed users to:    
        - Add products to the cart  
        - View items in the cart  
        - Remove items from the cart  
-  **Hooks Integration** — Used `useDispatch` and `useSelector` to:      
        - Dispatch actions to update state  
        - Access global store data from any component  
-  **Seamless State Flow** — Ensured consistent data updates and improved scalability through centralized state management.

---

### Learning Outcomes
- Set up and configure **Redux Toolkit** in a React project.  
- Manage global state effectively with **slices** and **reducers**.  
- Use **React-Redux hooks** (`useDispatch`, `useSelector`) for clean and functional data access.  
- Build interactive UI components that respond to global state changes.

This lab demonstrates how **Redux Toolkit** simplifies complex state management and improves React app scalability.   
By building an e-commerce platform with a dynamic shopping cart, I gained hands-on experience with global state handling and user-driven interactions.
